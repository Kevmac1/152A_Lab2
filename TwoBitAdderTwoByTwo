//The fourBitAdder_TwoByTwo is a 4-bit adder module designed to add two 4-bit binary numbers with an optional carry-in.
//It achieves this by chaining two instances of a 2-bit adder (twoBitAdder), allowing for the addition of the lower and upper 2 bits separately, with carry propagation between them.
